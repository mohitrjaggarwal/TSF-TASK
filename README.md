# TSF-TASK
NOTES:
WE HAVE A SMALL DATASET THIS TIME, SO CROSS-VALIDATION IS AVOID.
WE CAN ALSO EXAMINE THE DIVERSITY IN TRAINING AND TEST DATA.
SOMETIMES DECISIONTREE WORKS BETTER THAN RANDOMFOREST, OVERFITTING OF DATA.
DATASET USED WAS NOT HAVING ANY DISCREPANCIES SO IT DIDN'T REQUIRE DATA-ENGINEERING OR PREPROCESSING.
WE CAN PLOT A LOT MORE VISUALS IF REQUIRED.
RANDOMFOREST CLASSIFIER IS ACTUALLY ENSEMBLED DECISION TREE, WE TAKE AVERAGE OF DECISIONS.
TUNING HYPERPARAMETERS FOR BETTER RESULTS WAS EXERCISED TO AN EXTENT.
